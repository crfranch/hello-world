# hello-world
New to coding, HTML was the only thing I had a small glimpse of exposure to at work. I'm trying to become a better coder through small projects and would appreciate any feedback one may have to offer. Thanks. 
I'm a big foodie; I enjoy trying small, hole-in-the-wall type of restaurants. I enjoy traveling to visit friends, being outdoors and watching sports. I have a black lab named Addie who knows the way to my heart. when I'm not at work, I'm spending time with my family and/or friends at the firepit in my backyard. I'm more of a homebody but I enjoy going out if that's where the action is.
